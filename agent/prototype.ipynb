       "'Page: Frieren\\nSummary: Frieren: Beyond Journey\\'s End (Japanese: 葬送のフリーレン, Hepburn: Sōsō no Furīren, pp. \"Frieren, the Final Farewell to the Dead\") is a Japanese manga series written by Kanehito Yamada and illustrated by Tsukasa Abe. It has been serialized in Shogakukan\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday since April 2020, with its chapters collected in twelve tankōbon volumes as of December 2023. The series is licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. An anime television series adaptation produced by Madhouse premiered in September 2023.\\nBy December 2023, the manga had over 17 million copies in circulation. In 2021, Frieren: Beyond Journey\\'s End won the 14th Manga Taishō and the New Creator Prize of the 25th annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.\\n\\nPage: Frieren (character)\\nSummary: Frieren (Japanese: フリーレン, Hepburn: Furīren) is the title character and protagonist of the Japanese manga series Frieren: Beyond Journey\\'s End, written by Kanehito Yamada and illustrated by Tsukasa Abe. Frieren is a former member of the party of adventurers who defeated the Demon King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-year quest. Frieren returns to the capital fifty years later; however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. After one last adventure to see the meteor shower, Himmel dies of old age. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not attempting to learn more about him. Frieren then pays a visit to her other former comrades. She accepts an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned child adopted by Heiter. She also receives an invitation to travel far north, to the resting place of souls, and see Himmel again to bid the hero a fitting farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey together with Fern while still pursuing her passion for learning magic.\\nWhile initially conceptualized as a comical fighter, Yamada scrapped multiple ideas she had for Frieren until deciding to make her an elf who grows in the story while remembering Himmel. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki in Japanese and Mallorie Rodak in English. Critical response to Frieren\\'s character was mostly positive due to how the series focuses on Frieren\\'s view of life and how she aims to become a better person. The further exploration of her dark past was also praised for how it changed people\\'s views of her.\\n\\n'"

    "Using OpenAPI has a major drawback in that it naturally causes the LLM to perform inference more than necessary due to the sheer number of endpoints available. As the LLM performs reasoning to respond to a user query, it calls any endpoint that may be helpful, despite the fact that often only one or two endpoints will return the necessary information. Considering that only a subset of the endpoints is necessary to achieve core functionality, this means the cost of inference is unnecessarily high. Thus, for AniMate, I will use the custom tools approach, and only implement tools for a subset of the endpoints. This will keep the number of tokens required for inference down and reduce the complexity of AniMate's implementation."

      "Summary: Frieren (Japanese: フリーレン, Hepburn: Furīren) is the title character and protagonist of the Japanese manga series Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, written by Kanehito Yamada and illustrated by Tsukasa Abe. Frieren is a former member of the party of adventurers who defeated the Demon King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-year quest. Frieren returns to the capital fifty years later; however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. After one last adventure to see the meteor shower, Himmel dies of old age. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not attempting to learn more about him. Frieren then pays a visit to her other former comrades. She accepts an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned child adopted by Heiter. She also receives an invitation to travel far north, to the resting place of souls, and see Himmel again to bid the hero a fitting farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey together with Fern while still pursuing her passion for learning magic.\n",
      "While initially conceptualized as a comical fighter, Yamada scrapped multiple ideas she had for Frieren until deciding to make her an elf who grows in the story while remembering Himmel. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki in Japanese and Mallorie Rodak in English. Critical response to Frieren's character was mostly positive due to how the series focuses on Frieren's view of life and how she aims to become a better person. The further exploration of her dark past was also praised for how it changed people's views of her.\n",
